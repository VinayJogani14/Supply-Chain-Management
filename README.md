#  Supply Chain Analytics Dashboard with Neo4j and LLM Integration

## Overview

This project presents a comprehensive **Supply Chain Analytics Dashboard** built using **Streamlit**, **Neo4j**, and (optionally) **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. The aim is to provide a robust, real-time, and intuitive visualization and analysis platform for supply chain data. The solution enables stakeholders to explore product flows, supplier networks, order timelines, and shipment statuses in a highly interactive and insightful manner.

## Key Features

- **Neo4j Graph Database** for modeling complex relationships between products, suppliers, orders, and shipments.
- **Interactive Dashboards** using Streamlit, Plotly, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
- **Natural Language Interface (Conceptual Integration)** using LLMs to interpret user queries and translate them into actionable Cypher queries.
- **Real-time Cypher Query Execution** through integrated Neo4j driver.
- **Data Exploration & Filtering** capabilities for deep-dives by departments, aisles, suppliers, and more.

## LLM & Neo4j Integration

### Neo4j

Neo4j enables this application to use a **graph-based approach** for managing the supply chain, modeling data through nodes and relationships. It allows for:

- Efficient traversal of complex supplier-product-order networks.
- Quick querying of dependencies and logistics paths.
- Better visualization and understanding of hidden insights through relationship-based queries.

#### Example Entities and Relationships:
- `(:Supplier)-[:SUPPLIES]->(:Product)`
- `(:Order)-[:CONTAINS]->(:Product)`
- `(:Product)-[:SHIPPED_IN]->(:Shipment)`

#### Cypher Query Example
```cypher
MATCH (s:Supplier)-[:SUPPLIES]->(p:Product)
RETURN s.name AS Supplier, collect(p.name) AS Products
```

### LLMs (Large Language Models)

Though not directly included in the initial Streamlit implementation, the architecture is **designed to support** LLM-powered query interfaces. This would involve:

- **NL2Cypher Translation**: Convert user queries like *"Show me all delayed shipments from supplier X"* into Cypher.
- **LLM Integration Plan**:
  - Capture user input via Streamlit UI.
  - Send input to an LLM API (e.g., OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4).
  - Parse the modelâ€™s response for a Cypher query.
  - Execute the query via Neo4j and visualize the results.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Streamlit
- Neo4j Desktop or Aura
- Internet (for future LLM API integration)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/supply-chain-analytics.git
cd supply-chain-analytics
```

2. **Set Up Virtual Environment**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ðŸ›  Example `requirements.txt`

```text
streamlit
pandas
numpy
plotly
seaborn
matplotlib
neo4j
```

3. **Launch Neo4j and Import Data**

- Start Neo4j Desktop or use Neo4j Aura.
- Create a new project and import the dataset CSVs.
- Use Cypher to create constraints and load nodes and relationships.

4. **Run the Streamlit App**

```bash
streamlit run Streamlit.py
```

## Dashboard Features

- Department-wise and Aisle-wise product distribution.
- Supplier-product mapping.
- Order-Product-Shipments timeline analysis.
- Custom Cypher query interface.
- Responsive and dynamic visuals powered by Plotly.

---

## Example Use Cases

- **Product Traceability**: Trace which suppliers provided which products in a given order.
- **Bottleneck Detection**: Identify which nodes in the supply chain cause shipment delays.
- **What-If Analysis**: Simulate disruptions and evaluate alternative paths (future with LLMs).
- **Business Intelligence**: Gain insight into top-selling departments, most frequent suppliers, etc.

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Full Natural Language Interface via OpenAI/GPT-4 APIs.
- [ ] Docker containerization for easier deployment.
- [ ] Multi-user support and authentication.
- [ ] Caching for faster query performance.
